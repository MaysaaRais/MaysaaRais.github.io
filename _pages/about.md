## About

I recently graduated from the Master's program in Finance and Data Technology at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, where I developed a solid foundation in quantitative finance, data science, and applied modeling.

My current focus is on designing reproducible models for option pricing, volatility dynamics, and market risk. All models are built from scratch in Python, with an emphasis on mathematical transparency, analytical control, and interpretability.

I am particularly interested in the intersection between financial engineering, intelligent automation, and systemic risk — with the goal of contributing to technically demanding and globally relevant environments.
