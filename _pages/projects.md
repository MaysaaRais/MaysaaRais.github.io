## Selected Projects in Quantitative Finance

This page highlights applied research and development work in financial engineering, with a focus on pricing models, volatility dynamics, and market risk analysis.  
All models are built from scratch in Python, with an emphasis on reproducibility, efficiency, and interpretability.

### ▸ Black-Scholes Pricing Engine  
Implementation of the analytical Black-Scholes formula for European options.  
Includes closed-form expressions for first- and second-order Greeks and visualization of volatility surfaces.

### ▸ Heston Model – Monte Carlo Simulation  
Simulation of stochastic volatility paths under the Heston model.  
Numerical pricing of European options via Monte Carlo and calibration of implied volatility smiles.

### ▸ Exotic Greeks Estimation  
Estimation of risk sensitivities (Delta, Vega, Gamma) for non-vanilla payoffs using pathwise and likelihood ratio methods.  
Evaluation of estimator bias and variance under different scenarios.

[Notebook coming soon]

---

### ▸ Volatility Forecasting – GARCH vs RNN  
Comparison of classical econometric models (GARCH, EGARCH) and deep learning methods (RNN) for short-horizon FX volatility prediction.  
Performance assessed via RMSE and backtested on high-frequency datasets.

[Notebook coming soon]

### ▸ Market Microstructure – Anomaly Detection  
Exploration of limit order book dynamics using tick-by-tick data.  
Unsupervised detection of anomalous trading patterns using statistical distance metrics and clustering.
